# Install EFI Boot Editor

## Build from source

### Dependencies

Necessary tools:

- [CMake](//cmake.org) (>= 3.16)
- [pkg-config](//www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)
- recent C/C++ compiler with C++17 support,
  recommended [GCC](//gcc.gnu.org/) (>= 7.5.0)
  or [Clang](//clang.llvm.org/) (>= 9.0.0),
  or [MSVC](//learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/) (>= 19.29.30146.0) on Windows

Required libraries[^1]:

[^1]: Remember to install **development** files as well. For example
  `qt6-base-dev`, `libefivar-dev`, `libefiboot-dev` on Ubuntu.

- [Qt5](//doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html) (>= 5.12)
  or [Qt6](//doc.qt.io/qt-6/get-and-install-qt.html) (>= 6.2)
- [efivar](//github.com/rhboot/efivar) (>= 37) on Linux

### Build steps

1. Configure:

    ```shell
    cmake -B build . \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
          [-Dparameter=value ...]

    -- The C compiler identification is GNU 12.2.0
    -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 12.2.0
    ...
    -- Build files have been written to: /efibooteditor/build
    ```

    Available parameters:

    - `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug,Release,RelWithDebInfo,MinSizeRel` - specifies
      the build type, can be used to overwrite custom/default C/C++ compiler
      flags with recommended values
    - `QT_VERSION_MAJOR=5,6` - force Qt5 or Qt6 build,
      useful if both are installed

2. Build

    ```shell
    cmake --build build --config Release

    [  5%] Automatic MOC and UIC for target efibooteditor
    ...
    [100%] Built target efibooteditor
    ```

3. Install

    ```shell
    cmake --install build

    -- Install configuration: ""
    -- Installing: /usr/bin/efibooteditor
    ...
    ```

### Other

There is also:

- a [package](//aur.archlinux.org/packages/efibooteditor) in
the AUR for Arch Linux
- and a [SPEC file](misc/efibooteditor.spec) for RPM based
distributions (thanks [@Justinzobel](https://github.com/Justinzobel)).

## Pre-built packages

[Releases](//github.com/Neverous/efibooteditor/releases) automatically build
a set of packages - they're mostly considered for testing purposes / making sure
that the code compiles correctly on various environments, but they should also
work just fine for normal usage. Just keep in mind they might have some specific
requirements inherited from the build environment.

### Assets

Packages follow a specific naming pattern:
EFIBootEditor-[{VERSION}](#version)-[{OS}](#os)-[{QT_VERSION}](#qt_version)-[{COMPILER}](#compiler).[{EXTENSION}](#extension).

#### VERSION

Release version.

#### OS

Operating system used during build and generally which was targeted for
the runtime. The package might work on other systems with similar versions of
system libraries.

#### QT_VERSION

Targeted Qt version, generally required to have compatible Qt version installed,
though some packages include all the necessary libraries in the bundles.

#### COMPILER

Compiler used during compilation, generally shouldn't matter but there might be
some bugs caught in one but not the other.

#### EXTENSION

Assets are delivered in various formats:

- `.dmg` - macOS App Bundle.
- `.deb` - Debian package - should also work on any Debian derivative as long
  as dependencies are met.[^2]
- `.ddeb` - Debian debug symbol package - primarily useful during troubleshooting.
- `.msi` - Windows installer.
- `.zip`, `.tar.zst` - simple archive files, should contain all necessary files,
  ready to use in-place after decompression (`.zip` is for Windows
  and `.tar.zst` is for macOS and Linux).

[^2]: Using `.deb` packages on old Ubuntu (< 21.10) or Debian (< bullseye)
  releases might require manual Qt installation as versions in the official
  repositories are older than the minimum requirements.
  In the CI [aqtinstall](//github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall) is used for
  installation, but then package install needs to be probably forced.
  Quick search through the internet also reveals PPAs with pre-built packages
  from [Stephan Binner](//launchpad.net/~beineri) that might be useful.
